# Virtuaaliluonto - Nuotiovahti

### Git repository for Virtuaaliluonto related project about non-intrusive surveilance using Raspberry pi.

---

What we are trying to achieve is a Raspberry Pi based IoT device with two to three sensors: movement, flame and perhaps smoke. The basic idea is to put the whole thing next to a campfire and collect useful data about the current status of that particular spot. Collected data is then sent over the web to our server which is hosting a site that hikers and campers can use to see whether the campfire spot is already occupied by others or if it has a fire going on.

One of the key features is to respect peoples privacy, so our prototype will not collect any data that can be linked to any specific person. After all in these days everything is somewhat connected to the internet and there are a lot of talk about peoples privacy.
